# ic-buttonset

An accessible buttonset component that plays w/ Twitter's 2.x Bootstrap styles.

## installation

```sh
$ npm install ic-buttonset
# or ...
$ bower install ic-buttonset
```

Or just grab `dist/main.js` and include it into your app however you'd
like.

## Usage

```handlebars
{{#ic-buttonset value=filter default="2"}}
  {{ic-button label="Open" value="1"}}
  {{ic-button label="Closed" value="2"}}
  {{ic-button label="All" value="3"}}
{{/ic-buttonset}}
```

Buttonsets take two optional parameters:

  * **value**: A property to bind this buttonset's value to.
  * **default**: The default value of the component. Must be a value used by one of the buttonset's buttons.

Buttons also have two parameters:
  * **label**: The text label of this button.
  * **value**: The value assigned to the bound property (see "value" on the buttonset).
